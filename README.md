## Calculator UI

This is the UI application of its backend [counterpart](https://github.com/veraszto/calculator-app)

Run `npm install`

Run it by specifying the backend address this way `CALCULATOR_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000 npm run start`, in case the backend is at `http://localhost:3000`

Navigate to http://localhost:8080

Please ensure the [backend](https://github.com/veraszto/calculator-app) has started already

### Thanks!
